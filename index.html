    <h2>The Rules of IT Ball</h2>
    <p1>For the serve, the ball must cross over the top of the net and land behind the first line in the middle of the court. The ball may be thrown off the side wall, but the same rules apply.</p1>
    <br />
    <p1>If the ball hits the net and lands in bounds, the serve is replayed, but any serve that is out of bounds is a fault. After the second fault the opponent will score a point.</p1>
    <br />
    <p1>After a ball is caught, it must be thrown with 3 seconds without moving more than 3 setps from the location of the catch, or passed to a teammate.</p1>
    <br />
    <p1>The ball can only bounce a certain number of times depending on the style of plays. For singles, the ball must bounce twice in the grass and a third time either in the grass or outside the grass for an opponent to score. For doubles, the ball must bounce once in the grass and a second time either in the grass or outside for an oppontent to score.</p1>
    <br />
    <p1>If the ball bounces off of a wall and lands back in bounds, the bounce still counts.</p1>
    <br />
    <p1>In singles, if the ball is bounces once in the court and then lands out of bounds, the point is replayed.</p1>
    <br />
    <p1>The side who wins the point will serve for the next point.</p1>
    <br />
    <p1>Any ball that is thrown under the net or outside of the grass is out of bounds and will score a point for an opponent.</p1>
    <br />
    <p1>Play continues until 11 points, and must be won by 2 points.</p1>
