    <h2>The Rules of IT Ball</h2>
    <p>For the serve, the ball must cross over the top of the net and land behind the first line in the middle of the court. The ball may be thrown off the side wall, but the same serving rules apply.</p>
    <p>If the ball hits the net and lands in bounds, the serve is replayed. Any serve that lands out of bounds is a fault. After the second fault, the opponent scores a point.</p>
    <p>After a ball is caught, it must be thrown within 3 seconds. The player may not take more than 3 steps from the location of the catch unless they pass to a teammate.</p>
    <p>The ball can only bounce a certain number of times depending on the style of play:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Singles:</strong> The ball must bounce twice in the grass and a third time either in the grass or outside for the opponent to score.</li>
        <li><strong>Doubles:</strong> The ball must bounce once in the grass and a second time either in the grass or outside for the opponent to score.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the ball bounces off a wall and lands back in bounds, the bounce still counts.</p>
    <p>In singles, if the ball bounces once in the court and then lands out of bounds, the point is replayed.</p>
    <p>The side that wins a point serves for the next point.</p>
    <p>Any ball thrown under the net or outside of the grass is considered out of bounds and results in a point for the opponent.</p>
    <p>Play continues until one side scores 11 points and is ahead by at least 2 points.</p>
